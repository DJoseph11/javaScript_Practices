/*  syntax parsers --- A program that reads your code and determines what it does and if its grammar is valid
*
*   lexical environment--- Where something sits physically in the coe4e you write
*
*   Execution context--- a wrapper to help manage the code that is running*/


/*  Name and value pair--- a name which maps to a unique value
*           // address = "100 main st."
*   Object--- A collection of name value pairs
*           // a value in a name can store other name value pairs
* */

/*  Whenever Js codes runs it runs inside an execution context meaning that the javascript engine wrap your code
*   and do its thing,like parsing and such.
*   And the base execution context is the global execution context.
*
