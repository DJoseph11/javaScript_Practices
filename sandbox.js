/*Syntax Parcer: is a program that reads your code and determines what it does and if its
* grammar is valid.
*
* parsing takes strings of character commands or a block of code and split them apart
* and break it down into separate pieces or components which are scanned for correct
* syntax or vocabulary  put it into a compiler and transforms it into machine language.
*
*
* Lexical Environment is where something sits physically in the code you write
* lexical means having to do with words or grammar so a lexical environment
* exist in programming languages to which where you write something is important.

// in the code above, before it is executed it pass through a syntax parser to machine
